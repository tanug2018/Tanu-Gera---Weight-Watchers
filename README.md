Coding Exercise
I have added chromedriver executable as the code will run on Chrome. It can be modifed to run on Firefox or IE by changing the driver object.
I have not added TestNg or Junit annotations as it was not mentioned that I need to create methods for all functionalities. I have created the method countFrequency as mentioned in coding exercise.
